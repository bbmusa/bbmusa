I'm currently diving deep into the world of Quant, and am always eager to learn more about it. If you have any questions related to Data Science, Quantitative Finance, or Machine Learning, feel free to ask me!

When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me gazing at the stars, creating some cool artwork, or trekking in the Himalayas (I've conquered three peaks so far!).

I'm fluent in Python, especially when it comes to essential libraries for finance and data science. I also have experience in algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis. If you need help with custom scanners, backtests, or any other kind of analysis, you can check out my website at http://10dalgo.in/.
